<h3>Copy With Some Paste</h3>
<p>Currently supported features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Paste Box" that syncs between accounts, making it easy to paste between devices</li>
  <li>Five "Clipboards" that hold the latest clipboard contents (also syncs between multiple devices)</li>
</ul>

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add copy functionality to the buttons next to the read only input fields</li>
  <li>Apply some CSS</li>
  <li>Once the extension is more polished, I'll add a feature that makes the count of clipboards dynamic, not static as it's now</li>
</ul>
