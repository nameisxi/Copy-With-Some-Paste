<h3>Copy With Some Paste</h3>
<p>Currently only supports one clipboard field, but I'm  going to fix this as soon as I have the time to figure out what's wrong with the storage API requests.</p>
<p>Currently supported features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paste Box that syncs between accounts, making it easy to paste between devices</li>
</ul>

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add copy functionality to the buttons next to the read only input fields</li>
  <li>Apply some CSS</li>
</ul>
